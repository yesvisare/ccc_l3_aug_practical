    "**Cause:** Sequential execution creates bottlenecks\n",

    "- **>30 second latency tolerance** (anything faster requires single-agent)\n",

    "### \u274c Avoid When:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Simple Queries\n",
    "Factual lookup (\"What's our return policy?\") doesn't benefit from planning-execution separation. Wastes resources on unnecessary coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Real-Time Applications\n",
    "<5 second requirements impossible with sequential multi-agent design. Minimum 9-15 seconds due to inherent coordination latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Low-Budget Projects\n",
    "<$500/month budgets consumed by 3x LLM costs and orchestration overhead. Single-agent better allocates resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Deterministic Workflows\n",
    "Fixed step processes (extract \u2192 classify \u2192 tag \u2192 store) should use scripted pipelines, not agents adding unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. High-Compliance Environments\n",

    "## 9. Key Takeaways & Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "\u2705 Built a three-agent orchestration system (Planner, Executor, Validator)\n",
    "\u2705 Implemented structured message passing with LangGraph\n",
    "\u2705 Understood conditional routing and state management\n",
    "\u2705 Identified when multi-agent complexity is justified (rarely!)\n",
    "\u2705 Learned common failure patterns and prevention strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-agent is expensive:** 3x cost, 2-5x latency - only justified when quality improvement measured >20% via A/B testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adaptive routing is essential:** 90% of queries better served by single-agent. Use complexity heuristics to route appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role constraints prevent confusion:** Explicit DO/DON'T lists in prompts keep agents focused on their designated tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation needs specificity:** Generic feedback creates loops. Require actionable, specific gap identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "Before deploying:\n",
    "- [ ] Implement adaptive routing (simple \u2192 single-agent)\n",
    "- [ ] Set up monitoring (P95 latency per agent, validation rejection rate)\n",
    "- [ ] Configure cost alerts (>$0.10 per query)\n",
    "- [ ] Add iteration limits (max 3) to prevent runaway loops\n",
    "- [ ] Test all routing edge cases (missing values, parsing failures)\n",
    "- [ ] Cache planner outputs for similar queries\n",
    "- [ ] A/B test vs single-agent to confirm quality improvement >20%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Module\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module 11:** Advanced RAG patterns for production scale\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** Multi-agent orchestration is a powerful tool, but like any power tool, it's easy to misuse. Start with single-agent, measure quality gaps, and only introduce multi-agent complexity when A/B testing proves it's worth the 3x cost and 2-5x latency trade-off."
