    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You built usage metering in M12.1. You track every query, embedding, and token consumed. Your ClickHouse dashboard shows exactly what each tenant is using.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But:** You're still manually invoicing customers at the end of each month. You spend 8-10 hours exporting usage data, calculating costs, creating invoices, and chasing payments.\n",

    "- At 10 customers: Manageable\n",
    "- At 50 customers: 2 full days every month\n",
    "- At 100+ customers: Unsustainable\n",

    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrate Stripe to automate your entire billing lifecycle:\n",
    "- Subscription management\n",
    "- Usage-based charges\n",
    "- Payment retries with dunning logic\n",

    "- Integrate Stripe for subscription and usage-based billing\n",
    "- Automate invoice generation from M12.1 metering data\n",
    "- Handle payment failures with proper dunning logic\n",
    "- Manage subscription lifecycles (trials, upgrades, cancellations)\n",

If fails \u2192 retry with dunning\n\n### Why This Matters for Production\n\n- **Scalability:** Handles millions of transactions without custom code\n- **Compliance:** PCI-compliant payment handling (you never touch credit cards)\n- **Automation:** Invoicing, retries, receipts all handled automatically\n- **Reporting:** Built-in revenue analytics and tax calculation\n\n**Common Misconception:** \"I can build this myself in a weekend.\" \n**Reality:** Payment processing has edge cases (partial refunds, prorations, failed retries, dispute handling) that take months to build properly.",

   "source": "## Section 6: Common Failures (Production Issues)\n\n### Failure 1: Webhook Missed Events (Payment Not Recorded)\n\n**Root Cause**: Webhook endpoint takes >5 seconds, Stripe times out and stops retrying after 3 days.\n\n**What You'll See**:\n- Customer paid but database shows `billing_status='payment_failed'`\n- Customer complaint: \"I paid but my service is suspended\"\n\n**The Fix**:\n```python\n# BEFORE (slow, synchronous):\n@app.post(\"/webhooks/stripe\")\nasync def webhook(request):\n    event = verify_webhook(request)\n    await process_event(event)  # Slow!\n    return {\"status\": \"success\"}\n\n# AFTER (fast, asynchronous):\n@app.post(\"/webhooks/stripe\")\nasync def webhook(request):\n    event = verify_webhook(request)\n    background_tasks.add_task(process_event, event)\n    return {\"status\": \"success\"}  # Returns in <100ms\n```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Webhook endpoints should ONLY verify signature and queue the event\n- All processing happens asynchronously (Celery, SQS, Pub/Sub)\n- Monitor webhook response time (<500ms target)\n\n---\n\n### Failure 2: Billing Calculation Errors (Over/Undercharging)\n\n**Root Cause**: Usage sync reports wrong quantity (e.g., counting cached + database queries = double counting).\n\n**The Fix**:\n- Single source of truth for usage (ClickHouse events table)\n- Use `action=\\\"set\\\"` not `\\\"increment\\\"` for idempotency\n- Automated daily comparison: Stripe usage records vs ClickHouse aggregations\n\n---\n\n### Failure 3: Invoice Generation Failures (Customer Not Billed)\n\n**Root Cause**: Subscription has no payment method attached. Trial ends, Stripe can't charge, invoice stays in \\\"draft\\\" forever.\n\n**The Fix**:\n- Require payment method at signup (before trial starts)\n- Send reminders 3 days before trial ends\n- Monitor subscriptions in \\\"incomplete\\\" status daily\n\n---\n\n### Failure 4: Payment Retry Bugs (Premature Suspension)\n\n**Root Cause**: Webhooks arrive out of order. `payment_failed` webhook processed after `payment_succeeded` already happened.\n\n**The Fix**:\n```python\nasync def handle_payment_failed(invoice_data):\n    # Always check CURRENT state in Stripe\n    latest_invoice = stripe.Invoice.retrieve(invoice_id)\n    \n    # Only suspend if STILL unpaid\n    if latest_invoice.status in [\\\"open\\\", \\\"uncollectible\\\"]:\n        if latest_invoice.attempt_count >= 3:\n            await suspend_tenant(tenant_id)\n    else:\n        logger.info(f\\\"Ignoring old webhook - invoice already paid\\\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### Failure 5: State Conflicts (Stripe vs Database Mismatch)\n\n**Root Cause**: Customer cancels in Stripe Dashboard, your database still shows `billing_status='active'`.\n\n**The Fix**:\n- Daily reconciliation job (Stripe \u2192 DB sync)\n- Webhook reliability monitoring\n- Admin dashboard showing discrepancies",

Typical ROI: 40-hour setup cost paid back in 4-6 months via time savings.\n\n---\n\n**\u274c LIMITATION: Complex Edge Cases Require Manual Intervention**\n\nProrations on mid-month plan changes are messy, international tax compliance needs manual configuration for some regions, billing disputes from confused customers require support team involvement. **Expect 2-5% of invoices to need manual review in first 6 months.**\n\n---\n\n**\ud83d\udcb0 COST: Stripe Fees + Infrastructure + Time Investment**\n\n- Stripe fees: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (~3-4% of revenue)\n- Infrastructure: $100-200/month (Celery workers, monitoring)\n- Engineering: 40 hours setup + 5 hours/month maintenance\n- **Total: 4-5% of revenue at 100 customers scale**\n\n---\n\n**\ud83e\udd14 USE WHEN: 10+ Customers with Monthly/Annual Subscriptions**\n\nUse if you have (or will reach within 6 months):\n- >10 paying customers\n- Monthly or annual billing cycles\n- Validated pricing model (not changing every 2-3 months)\n- SMB/mid-market customers who accept credit card payments\n\n---\n\n**\ud83d\udeab AVOID WHEN: <10 Customers or Enterprise-Only Sales**\n\nSkip if you have:\n- <10 customers and no growth plan (manual invoicing faster at this scale)\n- All customers are enterprise with annual contracts and net-30 terms\n- Pricing model still experimental (changing monthly)\n\n---\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n| Your Situation | Best Choice | Why |\n|----------------|-------------|-----|\n| <10 customers, B2B only | Manual invoicing (QuickBooks) | Time efficient at small scale |\n| 10-500 customers, SMB/B2C | **Stripe** (today's approach) | Best balance of features/cost |\n| >500 customers, complex pricing | Chargebee/Recurly | Handles complexity |\n| International heavy (>50%) | PayPal/Braintree | Better global coverage |\n| >$1M ARR, custom needs | Kill Bill (open source) | Ownership and control |\n\n---\n\n### When NOT to Use\n\n**Scenario 1**: Very Small Customer Base (<10 customers paying >$500/mo)\n- **Why it fails**: 40-hour setup vs 10 hours/month manual work = 4-6 month payback\n- **Use instead**: Manual invoicing (QuickBooks/Xero)\n\n**Scenario 2**: Enterprise-Only with Custom Contracts\n- **Why it fails**: Enterprise expects invoices, not credit card charges. Payment terms net-30/60/90.\n- **Use instead**: Manual invoicing with accounting software\n\n**Scenario 3**: Uncertain Pricing Model (changing every 2-3 months)\n- **Why it fails**: Stripe price IDs are immutable, migration between models is complex\n- **Use instead**: Wait until pricing stabilizes",
