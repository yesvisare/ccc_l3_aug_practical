    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In M7.1, you built distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry. You can see that your P95 query latency is 3.2 seconds. You know **WHICH** requests are slow. But here's the problem: you don't know **WHY** they're slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world scenario:**\n",
    "- Production RAG system P95 latency jumped from 1.5s to 4.8s overnight\n",
    "- Traces showed slowdown was in 'generate response' span\n",
    "- That span had 47 function calls inside it\n",
    "- **Without APM:** 6 hours of manual logging to find the bottleneck\n",
    "- **With APM:** 30 seconds to identify O(n²) loop in embeddings.py line 247\n",

APM agent samples your Python process (default: 100 samples/second)\n2. Each sample captures the call stack (which functions are executing)\n3. Over time, you get a statistical profile: \"85% of time is in chunk_filter()\"\n4. APM correlates this with your OpenTelemetry traces\n\n### Key Distinction\n\n**APM COMPLEMENTS tracing, doesn't replace it:**\n- Tracing: Shows request flow between services (the 'what' and 'where')\n- APM: Shows code execution within a service (the 'why')",
